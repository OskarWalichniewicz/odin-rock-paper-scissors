This is implementation of exercise [Project: Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) and [Revisting Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this exercise is to practice **CSS**, **HTML** and **JavaScript** elements taught so far.

I'll also put emphasis on gaining experience using **Git**, eg.:

- using the [Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/).
